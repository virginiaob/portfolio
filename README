# VIR'S PORTFOLIO

This is Virginia's portfolio. All changes should be kept in master.
The website is due to be refactored later in the future to make the site more reliable and maintainable.

## Deployment

This repo is connected to github pages. In particular, to `virginiaob.github.io`.
The GH pages domain is proxied through the site hosted in a DNS server.
To deploy, we just need to merge master into the `gh-pages` branch by doing in the console:

```
git checkout gh-pages #goes to the gh pages branch
git merge master
git push origin gh-pages #sync changes in GH
git checkout master #goes back to master for development
```
